title: DataFrames.jl - Tools for working with data in Julia

---

# Overview

The DataFrames package provides the essential tools you need for working with statistical data in Julia.

In particular, DataFrames provides:

* `NA`: A new Julia type that represents a missing value
* `DataArray`: A new Julia type that emulates Julia's standard `Array` type, but adds the ability to store missing values in the array
* `DataFrame`: A new Julia type that represents tabular datasets like those found in typical databases or spreadsheets
* I/O routines for reading and writing data files
* Database-style joins between two `DataFrame` objects
* Split-apply-combine operations
* Reshaping and pivoting operations
* Streaming data processing operations

To learn more about specific features, read the relevant section of the DataFrames manual. We recommend starting with the "Getting Started" section.

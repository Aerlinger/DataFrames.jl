title: DataFrames.jl - Tools for working with data in Julia

---

# Overview

The DataFrames package provides the essential tools you need for working with statistical data in Julia.

In particular, DataFrames provides:

* `NA`: A new Julia type that represents a missing value
* `DataArray`: A new Julia type that emulates Julia's standard `Array` type, but adds the ability to store missing values in the array
* `DataFrame`: A new Julia type that represents tabular datasets like those found in typical databases or spreadsheets

To learn more about specific features, read the relevant section of the DataFrames manual.

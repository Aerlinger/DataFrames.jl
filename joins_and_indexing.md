# Database-Style Joins and Indexing

## Joining Data Sets Together

We often need to combine two or more data sets together to provide a complete
picture of the topic we are studying. For example, suppose that we have the
following two data sets:

    names = DataFrame(ID = [1, 2], Name = ["John Doe", "Jane Doe"])
    jobs = DataFrame(ID = [1, 2], Job = ["Lawyer", "Doctor"])

We might want to work with a larger data set that contains both the names and
jobs for each ID. We can do this using the `join` function:

    full = join(names, jobs, on = "ID")

In relational database theory, this operation is generally referred to as a
join. The column used to determine which rows should be combined during a join
is called the key. If you do not specify the key when calling `join`, the
`join` function will attempt to identity a commonly named column in the
DataFrame arguments for use as a key:

    full = join(names, jobs)

There are four sorts of joins supported by the DataFrames package:

* Inner: The output contains rows for values of the key that exist in both
  the first (left) and second (right) arguments to `join`.
* Left: The output contains rows for values of the key that exist in the
  first (left) argument to `join`, whether or not that value exists in the
  second (right) argument.
* Right: The output contains rows for values of the key that exist in the
  second (right) argument to `join`, whether or not that value exists in
  the first (left) argument.
* Outer: The output contains rows for values of the key that exist in the
  first (left) or second (right) argument to `join`.

You can control the kind of join that `join` performs using the `kind`
keyword argument:

    a = DataFrame(ID = [1, 2], Name = ["A", "B"])
    b = DataFrame(ID = [1, 3], Job = ["Doctor", "Lawyer"])
    join(a, b, on = "ID", kind = :inner)
    join(a, b, on = "ID", kind = :left)
    join(a, b, on = "ID", kind = :right)
    join(a, b, on = "ID", kind = :outer)
